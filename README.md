> Generating signed URLs for CloudFront links is a little more tricky than for S3. It's because signature generation for S3 URLs is handled a bit differently than CloudFront URLs and this functionality is not currently supported by the [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js) library for JavaScript. In case you also need to do this, I've created this simple utility to make things easier.

### install

```sh
yarn add aleclarson/aws-cloudfront-sign#2.2.1
```
